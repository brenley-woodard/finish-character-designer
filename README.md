## The Golden Rule:

🦸 🦸‍♂️ `Stop starting and start finishing.` 🏁

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Vertical Slices

1. Plan. Read over given code and identify needed changes.
2. Complete Character design & display
    - Set image source properties for middle and pants
    - Make event listeners that change character properties based on selected value
    - Redisplay character
3. Make phrases function
    - create a li item for phrases and add(append) to the list
    - make event listener push phrases to character.phrases array
    - redisplay phrases
    - add logic that doesn't output li item if phrase value is blank
